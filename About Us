The idea for out project is to develop 
an app that a user can open at any time
or anywhere and be able to view menus 
from both local and nationwide restaurants.
This is motivated by the constant problem
of not knowing a restaurant menu until 
either going to their website or going
into said restaurant. With this app 
everything will be simplified and accessed
through a couple of clicks instead of 
having to google and find the restaurants 
website and menu tab.
