# Menu-Hub
An all in one app for restaurant menu's nationwide using crowd sourcing.  


### For system requirements and instructions to build and install the app see [installation.md](https://github.com/WSU-4110/Menu-Hub/blob/master/installation.md)


## Functionalities
There are various functionalities our app offers. Users will be able to search for menus, upload new menus, report incorrect menus. 

## Purpose
The purpose of our app is to develop an app that a user can open at any time, anywhere and be able to view menus from both local and nationwide restaurants. This is motivated by the constant problem of not knowing a restaurantâ€™s menu until either going to their website or going inside the restaurant. With this app, everything will be simplified and accessed through a couple of clicks instead of having to google and find the restaurant's website and menu tab. The app will also allow users to search for available restaurants with a specified distance and determine the distance from the user to the restaurant whose menu the user is looking at.
