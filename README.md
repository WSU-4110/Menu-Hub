# Menu-Hub
An all in one app for restaurant menu's nationwide using crowd sourcing.  


### For system requirements and instructions to build and install the app see [installation.md](https://github.com/WSU-4110/Menu-Hub/blob/master/installation.md)


## Functionalities
There are various functionalities our app offers. Users will be able to search for menus, upload new menus, report incorrect menus, and save menus locally to the device. For the search feature, this will allow users to look up existing menus that have already been added to the app. Once a user searches for a restaurant that exists in the app, they will be able to open up the menu. Users will also have the option to save the menu to their device if they choose to do so. If a restaurant does not exist in the app, users are able to upload a new menu. If a user finds that a menu is incorrect or the wrong menu was uploaded, they will have the ability to report the menu so it can be reviewed. 

## Purpose
The purpose of our app is to develop an app that a user can open at any time, anywhere and be able to view menus from both local and nationwide restaurants. This is motivated by the constant problem of not knowing a restaurantâ€™s menu until either going to their website, calling the restaurant or going inside the restaurant. With this app, everything will be simplified and accessed through a couple of clicks instead of having to google and find the restaurant's website and menu tab. The app will also allow users to search for available restaurants with a specified distance and determine the distance from the user to the restaurant whose menu the user is looking at.
